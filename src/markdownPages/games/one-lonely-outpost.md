## A cozy farming game, set in space

One Lonely Outpost is a farming simulator set in space, in which you are the pioneer on a sterile alien planet. You must turn the planet on a viable colony, managing resources, growing a colony and uncovering this new alien world. The game is [out now on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465550/One_Lonely_Outpost/) and there are plans for release on consoles such as Switch, PlayStation and Xbox.

I worked on OLO, as we on the team called the project, as a shader programmer and VFX artist from May of 2022 to October 2023. Aside from shaders & VFX, I also created systems for vegetation growth, character customization, set up post processing stacks and lighting. Below I write about some of my work on the project.
